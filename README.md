# Custom Collections & Extensions
This repository contains custom generic collection types and extension methods implemented in C# with .NET. The project is designed to experiment with and understand how built-in collections like List<T> work internally while also providing useful extension methods to enhance .NET development.

## Features  
- **Custom Generic Collections**: Implements a list-like collection (`RefatList<T>`) with basic operations.  
- **Extension Methods**: Includes useful extension methods with lambda expression to enhance existing .NET types.  
- **Generics & IEnumerable<T>**: Demonstrates the use of C# generics and iteration patterns.
